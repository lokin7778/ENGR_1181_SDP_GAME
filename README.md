# INTRODUCTION

1. Welcome to 'Kana no Densetsu', the warrior game, which is made completely using MATLAB and a simple game engine file. This game is designed for young-adults who are keen in learning basic Japanese. 

2. You can play this game in two modes, either to story mode, which will introduce to a story and then ask you questions based on that or an infinite Hiragana mode, which is basically just questions till the user decides to quit externally.
